# Topics to prepare

- Implement distributed caching in Go that is used by multiple servers (using mutex locks).
- Sequencing goroutines: Design and implement a Golang program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 in the correct sequence, with even numbers printed by one goroutine and odd numbers printed by a separate goroutine. The output should be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
- Difference beween arrays and slices in Go.
- How does the capacity of a slice grow in Go when it exceeds its capacity?
- Garbage collection in Go: How does Go manage memory?
- What is rune in Go?
